# A business Card

This repository is a business card as a simple static website.
Only plain HTML and CSS is used here.

It is published on [Github pages](https://giacomo-dantonio.github.io/dies-bildnis/).

## The repository name

The name of the repository refers to the Aria
*Dies Bildnis ist bezaubernd schön* from Mozart's Opera
*Die Zaberflöte* (The Magic Flute).

Tamino gets a business card of princess Tamina from the three
ladies (well, actually a picture) and instantly falls in love
with her.
